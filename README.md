# Wii Fit Body Check Channel
Honestly not entirely sure why this exists, but the user was given an SD Card with a file on it which contained the name of an instructor and their email. Messages were sent through Wii Mail.

## How to use
- Own Personal Trainer Walking + the pedometer.
- Get an SD Card (2 GB or less, SDHC will not work).
- Run the application and move the resulting `user.fdu` to `/private/wii/app/HFNJ/user.fdu` on the root of your SD Card.
- Launch Wii Fit Body Check Channel with the SD Card inserted and register your Mii.
